**Annotations:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `a` or `Enter` (diff pane) | Annotate current diff line |
| `A` | Add file-level annotation (stored at top of diff) |

**View:**

|-----|--------|
| `f` | Toggle filter: all files / annotated only |
| `q` | Quit, output annotations to stdout |

## Output Format

On quit, revdiff outputs annotations to stdout:

```
## handler.go (file-level)
consider splitting this file into smaller modules

## handler.go:43 (+)
use errors.Is() instead of direct comparison

## store.go:18 (-)
don't remove this validation
```

Each annotation block: `## filename:line (type)` where type is `(+)` added, `(-)` removed, or `(file-level)`.

Use `--output` / `-o` flag to write annotations to a file instead of stdout.
